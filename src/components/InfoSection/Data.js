  description:
    "I am a father of two, a United States Army Veteran, and a Software Engineering Senior at Iowa State University. For as long as I can remember, I have been a technology enthusiast. Some of my fondest memories from childhood are learning how to navigate the file structure, changing settings, and reformatting the operating system when I occasionally broke something. Spring 2020 I began Software Engineering school at Iowa State University. I anticipate graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering in May 2023. I am a lifelong learner who is passionate and enthusiastic about technology.",
