  description:
    'I am a father of two, a United States Army Veteran, and a Software Engineering Senior at Iowa State University. For as long as I can remember, I have been a technology enthusiast. Some of my fondest memories from childhood are learning how to navigate the file structure, changing settings, and reformatting the operating system when I occasionally broke something. Spring 2020 I began Software Engineering school at Iowa State University. Aside from school I have enjoyed constructing small programs like "Bop-It!", "Word Fall", and "Snake" using languages like C, Java, and JavaScript. Most recently I have been developing in the AWS cloud. I am enthusiastic to continue to learn and grow!',
