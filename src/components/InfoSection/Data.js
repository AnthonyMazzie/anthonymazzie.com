  description:
    'I am a father of two, a United States Army Veteran, and a Software Engineering Junior at Iowa State University. For as long as I can remember, I have been a technology enthusiast. Some of my fondest memories from childhood are learning how to navigate the file structure, changing settings, and reformatting the operating system when I occasionally broke something. I spent a large portion of my professional life in the military and working as a chef, but in 2019 I began Software Engineering school at Iowa State University. Aside from school I have enjoyed constructing small programs like "Bop-It!", and "Word Fall" on my own using languages like C and Java. Most recently I built this website using ReactJS and hosted it using Amazon Web Services. I am enthusiastic to continue to learn and grow.',
